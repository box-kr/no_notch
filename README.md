# NoNotch

A lightweight macOS utility application that **removes the notch** from your menu bar on MacBooks with notched displays.

It works by automatically adjusting the display resolution to fit the area below the notch, ensuring your menu bar contents are never hidden.

## 📝 Release Notes (v1.0.84)

- **Reliable Notch Detection in All Conditions**:
  - Automatically detects the presence and height of your display notch even if your screen resolution is already scaled or if screen layouts change.
- **Safe Startup & Flawless Full-Screen Restoration**:
  - When launched on a display already set to hide the notch, the app runs safely without scaling the layout down further. Turning off the notch hider reliably restores your display back to its original full-screen resolution.
- **More Intuitive Menu Options**:
  - Re-aligned options to match expectations—selecting "Enable Notch Bar" restores the screen to its natural state (notch visible), while "Disable Notch Bar" adjusts the screen to keep the notch hidden.
- **Instant Menu Bar Icon Updates**:
  - The menu bar icon now instantly updates to reflect your screen's current status (hidden or visible) regardless of how the notch is being hidden (via resolution change or desktop wallpaper modification), resolving icon rendering lag.

## 📝 Previous Updates (v1.0.47)

- **Hide Notch (Black Menu Bar) Reliability Improvement**:
  - Fixed an issue on newer macOS versions (Monterey and later) where transparent window overlays were ignored by the menu bar's blur effect.
  - The app now perfectly hides the notch by dynamically synthesizing a black bar directly onto your desktop wallpaper. This ensures seamless and stable compatibility across multiple monitors and Mission Control spaces.

## 📝 Previous Updates (v1.0.46)

- **Dialog Window Visibility Improvements**:
  - Fixed an issue where the settings dialog persisted above all other windows, blocking content. It now acts as a standard window that can be layered naturally.
  - Adjusted the application so the dialog is no longer completely hidden when you click away. It now remains accessible via the app switcher (Cmd + Tab).
  - Improved compatibility with macOS Mission Control (Exposé) — the configuration window will now properly thumbnail and participate in your workspace overviews for easy access.
- **UI Text Updates**: Updated dialog toggle button labels for improved clarity.

## 🔧 Core Architecture

### Display Mode Switching Strategy (`NotchOverlayManager`)

The app searches for the optimal display mode that fits below the notch using a 4-step strategy:

1. **Exact Match** — Same width + (Current height - Notch height).
2. **Same Width Nearest** — Same width, largest mode less than or equal to target height.
3. **Same Width Upper** — Same width, greater than target height but smaller than current.
4. **Similar Width** — Width within ±100px range, highest available resolution.

## ⚠️ Requirements

- macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later
- Apple Silicon (arm64) Mac
- Mac with a notched display (e.g., MacBook Pro 14"/16")
- Screen Recording / Accessibility permissions may be required for display mode changes.
